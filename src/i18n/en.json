    "title": "About Holistic Body Therapy",
    "text1": "I believe that health is not just the absence of illness or pain. Health is a state where the body, mind, senses, and one's own being are in harmony, and energy flows naturally. While modern life is convenient and full of information, it's easy to drift away from listening to our own body and mind. Even when we feel unwell, we often put it off, saying 'I'm too busy' or 'It can't be helped.' But our bodies continue to send us signals.",
    "text2": "My bodywork, 'Holistic Body Therapy' is a time to notice those signals again."

    "title": "Treatment Content",
    "text": "Holistic Body Therapy is a treatment that carefully observes the body's misalignments, stiffness, breathing, and circulation, and adjusts them according to each person's physical and mental patterns. I don't use forceful manipulation or cracking techniques. I touch only what's necessary, valuing 'awareness of one's own state' over immediate results. Clients often tell me: 'My breathing has deepened,' 'I feel lighter both physically and emotionally,' 'The quality of my sleep has changed.' The body and mind cannot be separated. When one is tired, it inevitably affects the other. That's why I value a holistic perspective that addresses the whole, not just parts."

  "why": {
    "title": "Why I Practice This Bodywork",
    "text": "Since childhood, I've seen many people close to me struggle with illness and discomfort. 'I wish they could live more energetically and joyfully'—that feeling is my origin. After studying human anatomy and movement in Australia and working with many people's bodies, I strongly felt that the same treatment or exercise has different effects on different people. Not just the body's condition, but lifestyle, mindset, and mental patterns greatly influence the results. This experience led to my current treatment style. My role is not to cure, but to create opportunities for awareness. How to adjust from there is up to each person. I support that first step of facing one's own body and mind."

For those with allergies or difficulty with grass treatments, we can flexibly accommodate your needs. Please feel free to consult with us."
      },
      "faq2": {
        "question": "What should I wear during treatment?",

      },
      "faq3": {
        "question": "How much of my body will be touched?",
        "answer": "Treatment is performed within the scope of adjusting muscles, joints, and posture. We do not touch sensitive areas or any areas that cause discomfort. If you feel any discomfort or unease during treatment, please let us know immediately."
